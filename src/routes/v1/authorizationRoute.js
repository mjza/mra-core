 * 
 * Validations performed:
 * - `dom`: Required. Must be a non-empty string. Represents the domain within which the action is attempted.
 * - `obj`: Required. Must be a non-empty string. Represents the object or resource the user is trying to access.
 * - `act`: Required. Must be a non-empty string. Represents the action the user is attempting to perform on the object.
 * - `attrs`: Optional. If provided, must be a JSON object. Represents additional attributes relevant to the authorization context.
 * 
 * If any validations fail, a 400 Bad Request response is sent with details of the validation errors.
 * If all validations pass, control is passed to the next middleware in the chain.

/**
 * Asynchronous middleware for authorizing user actions based on their permissions.
 * This function extracts required parameters from the request body and the authenticated
 * user's information, then uses a Casbin enforcer to determine if the action is authorized.
 *
 * The function expects the request body to contain:
 * - `dom`: The domain within which the action is attempted (e.g., a customer ID).
 * - `obj`: The object or resource the user is trying to access.
 * - `act`: The action the user is attempting to perform on the object.
 * - `attrs`: Optional. Additional attributes relevant to the authorization context, as a JSON object.
 *
 * Additionally, it requires `req.user` to contain the authenticated user's info, specifically a `username`,
 * and `req.enforcer` to provide a Casbin enforcer instance for performing authorization checks.
 *
 * @param {Object} req The request object, expected to include `user` info and the Casbin `enforcer` in its properties.
 * @param {Object} res The response object used to return the outcome of the authorization check.
 * @param {Function} next The next middleware function in the stack.
 *
 * On success (authorization granted), it calls `next()` to pass control to the next middleware.
 * On failure, it returns a JSON response with an error message and appropriate HTTP status code:
 * - 403 Forbidden if the user is not authorized.
 * - 400 Bad Request if required request parameters are missing or invalid.
 * - 500 Internal Server Error for any other errors encountered during processing.
 *
 * @async
 * @returns {Promise<void>} No explicit return value but may send a response to the client.
